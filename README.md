# networkx-library-workshop

Requires python 3 to run.
To run benchmark tests, open terminal and from directory simply run `python benchmark.py -f <file_name>` (available file names: astroph, chicago, livemocha, youtube, all). Using 'all' benchmarks all 4 files in a row.

Test can be timeouted to prevent long calculations. To change timeout, simply replace value in a `benchmark.py` file under `TIMEOUT` value.
